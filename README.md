# discourse-well-rounded-theme

This is a submission to the [Discourse CSS Theme Contest](https://meta.discourse.org/t/css-theme-contest-with-prizes/93770). While it can certainly be used in it's current state, there are many improvements I hope to bring to the theme with more time. These main priorities include:

- Mobile
- More polish
- Deep clean of the code

Feel free to preview this theme on the Discourse Theme Creator website:
